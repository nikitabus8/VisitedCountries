# VisitedCountries
Program that uses postgres to store the countries you visited (backend + frontend) from Angela's course with added features such as deleting countries from database.
Two postgres tables needed to run the program, empty "visited_countries" table with two collumns: id and country_code, and a "countries" table, I provided the csv file.
